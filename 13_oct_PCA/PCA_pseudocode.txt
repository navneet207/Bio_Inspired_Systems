Define objective function f(x)  // e.g., Rastrigin function

Initialize:
    grid_rows, grid_cols, dimensions
    lower_bound, upper_bound
    iterations

Create population grid:
    For each cell (i, j) in grid:
        Initialize cell solution randomly within bounds

best_solution = None
best_fitness = +∞

For iteration = 1 to iterations:
    Evaluate fitness of all cells:
        For each cell (i, j):
            fitness[i, j] = f(population[i, j])

    Update global best:
        Find cell with minimum fitness in the grid
        If minimum fitness < best_fitness:
            best_fitness = minimum fitness
            best_solution = corresponding cell solution

    Update population:
        For each cell (i, j):
            neighbors = get all neighbors of cell (i, j)  // Moore neighborhood with wrap-around
            best_neighbor_solution = population[i, j]
            best_neighbor_fitness = fitness[i, j]

            For each neighbor (ni, nj) in neighbors:
                If fitness[ni, nj] < best_neighbor_fitness:
                    best_neighbor_fitness = fitness[ni, nj]
                    best_neighbor_solution = population[ni, nj]

            If best_neighbor_fitness < fitness[i, j]:
                population[i, j] = best_neighbor_solution

Output best_solution and best_fitness
